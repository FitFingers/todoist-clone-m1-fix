<h1>Todo App</h1>
<p>
In this repo i am going to creating the popular <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> application using <b>create-react-app</b> as a base from scratch using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & React Testing Library (unit & integration testing). In addition to the latter technologies, I will be styling the application using SCSS (CSS) and following the BEM naming methodology and I will make sure that the application is fully responsive.
